A C#.NET utility for reading / writing SD cards and USB devices.\r\n\r\nLicensed under GNU General Public License 3.0 or later.\r\nSome rights reserved.

Thanks.)\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nThis utility is a C#.NET implementation of Win32DiskImager with a couple of features authors wanted to use:\r\n\r\n- writing images to a number of SD cards at once\r\n\r\n- reads/writes images to/from compressed file formats: ZIP, TGZ, GZ, XZ\r\n\r\n- remembers the last file you read/wrote \r\n\r\n- unmounts drives after write\r\n\r\n- provides more file filters within file dialog for typical image files (.img, .bin, .sdcard)\r\n\r\n- it also *might* be slightly faster when dealing with uncompressed read/write\r\n\r\n*NOTE: This application is under development and could possibly cause damage to your computer drive(s). We cannot take responsibility for any damage caused or losses incurred through use of this utility. Use at own risk!*\r\n\r\nCredits: Inspired by the excellent Win32DiskImager.\r\n\r\n## ChangeLog ##\r\n\r\n1.3.1 16/03/2015 RB Added MultiThreaded XZ compression & helping tooltips\r\n\r\n1.3.0 19/02/2015 RB Added XZ support\r\n\r\n1.2.2 21/01/2015 RB Added 'Remove drives after write' and drew new GUI\r\n\r\n1.2.1 14/01/15 RB Added Russian localization and tweaked GUI a bit.\r\n\r\n1.2.0 06/01/15 RB Added ability to write the same image to many SD simultaneously.
