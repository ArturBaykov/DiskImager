A C#.NET utility for reading / writing SD cards and USB devices\r\n\r\nLicense: This software utility is released under GPLv3.\r\n\r\nThe current release can be downloaded here \r\n\r\nhttp://www.dynamicdevices.co.uk/downloads/DiskImager.Installer.msi\r\n\r\n(Please feed back any platform testing you do, or any issues you encounter. Thanks.)\r\n\r\nThis utility is a C#.NET implementation, and adds a couple of features I wanted to see:\r\n\r\n- reads/writes images to/from compressed file formats: ZIP, TGZ, GZ\r\n\r\n- remembers the last file you read/wrote \r\n\r\n- provides more file filters within file dialog for typical image files (.img, .bin, .sdcard)\r\n\r\n- it also *might* be slightly faster when dealing with uncompressed read/write\r\n\r\n*NOTE This application is under development and could possibly cause damage to your computer drive(s). We cannot take responsibility for any damage caused or losses incurred through use of this utility. Use at own risk!*\r\n\r\nCredits: Inspired by the excellent Win32DiskImager.\r\n\r\nChangeLog\r\n=========\r\n\r\n1.0.2\t09/11/13\tAJL\t\tAdded support for reading and writing directly to compressed formats: .zip, .tgz, .gz\r\n\r\n\tTesting - Windows 8.1 Professional\r\n\r\n1.0.1\t08/11/13\tAJL\t\tRefactoring for cleanup.
